### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software engineer with over 15 years of coding experience. My journey has taken me through the realms of front-end and back-end development, For the past 9 years, I'm riding a wave of React. JS is my second nature, but recently I'm moving closer to the metal - targeting Go & Rust.ðŸŒ±

Over the years, I've jumped into different companies, playing the tech superhero. My mission? **To fix up their coding architecture, kick technical debt to the curb, and sprinkle in some top-notch practices.** The goal? **Faster, bug-free coding.** It's like giving their tech a turbo boost!

Sharing what I know is my jam. I've been hitting up conferences and workshops, helping other devs level up their skills. It's super rewarding to see others grow and get those "aha!" moments.

I've also embarked on a new adventure - my own YouTube channel! Here, I share insights, tricks, and lessons from my tech journey, and explore new trends in software architecture. Check it out and join me in this ever-evolving world of coding!

When I'm not coding, I'm buried in books - from cutting-edge tech manuals to timeless classics. These books are not just about coding; they offer insights into how technology intersects with business, market trends, and consumer behaviours. While I'm always looking ahead, learning the latest programming languages and techniques, I never forget to glance back at the wisdom of the past.

So, that's a glimpse into my world - a blend of code, sharing, learning, and continuous growth. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you'll engage with my content and share your own coding stories.
